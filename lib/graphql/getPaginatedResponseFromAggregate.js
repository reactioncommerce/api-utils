 * Resolvers that return multiple documents in the form of a connection should construct a

 * @name getPaginatedResponseFromAggregate
 * @method
 * @memberof GraphQL/ResolverUtilities
 * @summary Given a MongoDB aggregation pipeline, adds skip, limit, sort, and other filters as necessary
 *   based on GraphQL resolver arguments.
 * @param {MongoDB.Collection} collection MongoDB collection to run the aggregation pipeline on
 * @param {Array} pipeline MongoDB aggregation pipeline
 * @param {Object} args Connection arguments from GraphQL query
 * @param {Object} options Options
 * @param {Boolean} [options.includeTotalCount] Whether to return the `totalCount`. Default is `true`. Set this to
 *   `false` if you don't need it to avoid an extra database command.
 * @param {Boolean} [options.includeHasPreviousPage] Whether to return the `pageInfo.hasPreviousPage`.
 *   Default is `true`. Set this to `false` if you don't need it to avoid an extra database command.
 * @param {Boolean} [options.includeHasNextPage] Whether to return the `pageInfo.hasNextPage`.
 *   Default is `true`. Set this to `false` if you don't need it to avoid an extra database command.
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} `{ nodes, pageInfo, totalCount }`
